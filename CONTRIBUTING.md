   ```

5. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes, following the coding standards below

3. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. Run linters and formatters:
   ```bash
   black drafter/
   ruff check drafter/
   mypy drafter/
   ```

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes"
   ```

6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

### Coding Standards

- **Formatting**: We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) with a line length of 100
- **Linting**: We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for fast Python linting
- **Type Hints**: We use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Pre-commit hooks**: All commits should pass pre-commit checks

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage of new code
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with the prefix `test_`

To run tests:
```bash
pytest                  # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_file.py  # Run specific test file
pytest -v              # Verbose output
pytest --cov=drafter   # Run with coverage
```

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any changed functionality
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Update the README.md if you add new features
- Update change_log.md with your changes

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all tests and linters
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add an entry to `change_log.md` describing your changes
4. The PR will be reviewed by maintainers
5. Address any feedback from reviewers
6. Once approved, your PR will be merged
