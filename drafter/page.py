    """
    A page is a collection of content to be displayed to the user. This content has two critical parts:

    - The ``state``, which is the current value of the backend server for this user's session. This is used to
      restore the state of the page when the user navigates back to it. Typically, this will be a dataclass
      or a dictionary, but could also be a list, primitive value, or even None.
    - The ``content``, which is a list of strings and components that will be rendered to the user.

    The content of a page can be any combination of strings and components. Strings will be rendered as paragraphs,
    while components will be rendered as their respective HTML. Components should be classes that inherit from
    ``drafter.components.PageContent``. If the content is not a list, a ValueError will be raised.

    :param state: The state of the page. If only one argument is provided, this will default to be ``None``.
